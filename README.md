## UCI CS Helper Bot

This is a simple bot for Reddit that is meant to help out people at UCI. As I browse /r/UCI, I noticed that there are quite a few people who want to become Computer Science majors, but were accepted as Undeclared/Undecided, or as an non-CS, alternative major. So I got an idea to make this bot in order to help these people out.
